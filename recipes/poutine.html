        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            A traditional poutine recipe (pronounced 'poo-teen' or 'poo-tin' in English or 'poo-tsin' in Quebec), 
            is a bed of fries topped with cheese curds (not mozzarella cheese) and gravy. 
            Poutine is undoubtedly a Canadian dish that originated in Quebec in the 1950s, although, like many dishes, the true origin is debated.
